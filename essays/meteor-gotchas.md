"MY COMPUTER IS ON FIRE!"
One of the biggest issues I'm having is when I am initially creating a project on IntelliJ. The indexing takes forever to complete, so I'll be sitting there for minutes at a time waiting to start the assignment. Not only does it take an eternity to index, but my computer gets so hot that the fan goes berserk. My "solution" to this problem is that I pause the indexing process, close my computer, and wait for my laptop to cool down and the fan to stop going crazy. I wouldn't really consider it to be a solution because it takes up valuable time that I could be working on the WOD.(It also looks pretty ridiculous to be opening and closing my laptop every few minutes.) I'm sure there is possibly a more efficient, less time consumig way to handle the situation, but I have yet to find one.

While doing the digits assignment specifically, I'm having trouble keeping track of all the different files that I should be working in. It's seems simple when I watch the screencasts, but when I try to actually do the assingment myself I get lost at where I'm supposed to be doing the code. Also, I always mess up the location of the importing!! The contacts would not show up and I'd be so confused since I figured I did everything correct, only to find that I imported it wrong... I guess the only solution I can think of to fix this problem would be by continuous practice of the problems, but that then addressses the issue of the time I have to spend on doing the work.
