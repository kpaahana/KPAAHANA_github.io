"MY COMPUTER IS ON FIRE!"
One of the biggest issues I'm having is when I am initially creating a project on IntelliJ. The indexing takes forever to complete, so I'll be sitting there for minutes at a time waiting to start the assignment. Not only does it take an eternity to index, but my computer gets so hot that the fan goes berserk. My "solution" to this problem is that I pause the indexing process, close my computer, and wait for my laptop to cool down and the fan to stop going crazy. I wouldn't really consider it to be a solution because it takes up valuable time that I could be working on the WOD.(It also looks pretty ridiculous to be opening and closing my laptop every few minutes.) I'm sure there is possibly a more efficient, less time consumig way to handle the situation, but I have yet to find one. 



Now, describe two problems you’ve encountered while developing the digits application. Ideally, you will discuss one problem you had and how you solved it, and one problem you are currently having that you haven’t solved yet.

Alternatively, you can present two problems you’ve solved, or two problems you haven’t solved. Do whatever you feel will produce the most interesting essay.

When describing a problem that you’ve solved, write it in such a way that anyone else encountering that problem will know how to solve it.

When describing a problem that you haven’t solved, write it in such a way that others can help you solve it.
