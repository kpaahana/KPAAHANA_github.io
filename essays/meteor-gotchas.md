Now, describe two problems you’ve encountered while developing the digits application. Ideally, you will discuss one problem you had and how you solved it, and one problem you are currently having that you haven’t solved yet.

Alternatively, you can present two problems you’ve solved, or two problems you haven’t solved. Do whatever you feel will produce the most interesting essay.

When describing a problem that you’ve solved, write it in such a way that anyone else encountering that problem will know how to solve it.

When describing a problem that you haven’t solved, write it in such a way that others can help you solve it.
