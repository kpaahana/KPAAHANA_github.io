"MY COMPUTER IS ON FIRE!"
One of the biggest issues that I'm having is when I am initially creating a project on IntelliJ. 

<img class="ui left rounded floated image" src="/images/indexing.png" width = "400" height = "250"> 

The indexing takes forever to complete, so I'll be sitting in front of my laptop for minutes at a time waiting to start an assignment. Not only does it take an eternity to index, but my computer gets so hot that the fan goes berserk. My "solution" to this problem is that I pause the indexing process, close my computer, and wait for my laptop to cool down and the fan to stop going crazy. I wouldn't really consider it to be a solution because it takes up valuable time that I could be working on a project.(It also looks pretty ridiculous to be opening and closing my laptop every few minutes.) I'm sure there is possibly a more efficient, less time consumig way to handle the situation, but I have yet to find one.

Ever get that feeling of uneasiness when something is going so smoothly that it just seems too good to be true? Well, that's me with Meteor. I don't know if it's just my computer that's "working it's magic" or if there's something that I'm not doing "correctly", but throughout these past few weeks that I've been working with Meteor, I haven't had any huge problems-- at all.

Every single day someone would either express a problem he/she is having for Meteor, or I would hear about it on [Slack](https://slack.com/about), a messaging system designed to allow communication between people in the same team. As ridiculous as it sounds, I was at a point where I wanted to get errors just so that I could assure myself that there was nothing I was doing wrong, that I was "normal".

Overall, I'd have to say that Meteor was great to work with. And I can definitely not speak for everyone when I say this, but I found Meteor to be a basic yet efficient application when working with application design, and I wouldn't mind working with it in the future.
