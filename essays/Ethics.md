In the [Software Engineering Code of Ethics](https://www.computer.org/web/education/code-of-ethics), 

Software engineers shall participate in lifelong learning regarding the practice of their profession and shall promote an ethical approach to the practice of the profession
In Bill Sourour's Article, [The Code I'm Still Ashamed of](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/the-code-im-still-ashamed-of-e4c021dff55e), 

If you write code for a living, there’s a chance that at some point in your career, someone will ask you to code something a little deceitful – if not outright unethical.

Now write an interesting, informative technical essay about ethics in software engineering. You should begin by discussing, in your own words, what you think “ethics” means in the context of software engineering. Then, describe the situation you chose to analyze with respect to its ethical implications. Finally, present your conclusions: what is your personal opinion as to the ethical stance to be taken?
