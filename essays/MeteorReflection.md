Ever get that feeling of uneasiness when something is going so smoothly that it just seems too good to be true? Well, that's me with Meteor. I don't know if it's just my computer that working it's magic or if there's something that I'm not doing "correclty", but throughout these past few weeks that we've been working with Meteor, I haven't really had any huge problems-- at all. 

As ridiculous as it sounds, I was at a point where I wanted to get errors just so that I could assure myself that there was nothing I was doing wrong, that I was "normal".

Every single day someone would either express a problem he/she is having for Meteor, or I would hear about it on Slack. And, we even wrote about our sorrows in the "Meteor Gotchas" WOD. The only real problem (in general) that came to mind was my computer overheating when indexing (in IntelliJ to create a new project). And when the computer got hot the fan would become so obnoxiously loud that my "solution" was to pause the indexing and close my laptop until the sound settled down. 

Closing my laptop once is fine, but picture me doing that MULTIPLE times DURING A WOD-- not fun. Luckily for me, I was saved by the fact that during the last two weeks of working on digits, we only had to create branches off of the project (which required little to no indexing) and that we didn't have to create a new project for the WODs. 

Overall, I'd have to say that Meteor was great to work with. And I can definitely NOT speak for everyone when I say this, but I found Meteor to be a basic yet efficient application when working with application design, and I wouldn't mind working with it in the future.
