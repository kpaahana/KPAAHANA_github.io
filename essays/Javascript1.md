title: A Newbie's Thoughts on Javascript

This is my first time using Javascript, but overall it seems to be qute similar to Java. I'm very glad that declaring variables are a little easier since I don;t really have to worry about making something an integer, double, string, and so on. It really takes the stress off of having to remember all that.  

I have a sort of love-hate relationship with the WODs, and I can't seem to make up my mind on what my final stance is. It's great because it causes us to think very quick problem solvers, and it will most likely help with future job interviews. However, on the other hand, it can be very discouraging and stressful when you don't get it correct. Since it's either a pass or fail, it can be very damaging to a studen'ts overall grade. 

I believe that if we actually we over the answer code together in class it would be so much more helpful in understanding Javascript as a whole. This suggestion would be very similar to our practice WODs, in which everyone would complete the problem to the best of his/her ability in the time alotted and then would be able to check his/her work afterwards with the correct code. 

It's very important to remember that everyone learns differently. So, the reaction to the WODs will be very different as well. I think it's a little too soon to tell if this system of a "Work Out of the Day" is going to work for me personally, but it's definitely worth giving a try!
