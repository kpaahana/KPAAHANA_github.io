Last year, my aunty (who's a complete star wars fanatic) finally purchased the Lego Star Wars Millenial Falcon "for her son" (as she claims). But of course she had no intention of wasting her precious time trying to figure it out--so I had to do it.  Who would of have thought one model could be so complex with a tremendous amount of pieces, 1,329 TO BE EXACT.

I slaved away for hours, and after I was finally done, she took it, put it in a display case, and that was it... WHAT A WASTE OF MY LIFE. However, I have to admit that it probably would have been impossible to finish if it weren't for that trusty, old instruction manual-- a user's step-by-step guide to building the Lego Star Wars Millenial Falcon 101. 

So when I hear "design patterns", I think of my own instruction manual on how to figure out how to finish constructing different solutions solve many different situations that might come up in the coding process. Recently this year, there have been multiple projects assigned in my software engineering class where design patterns have come in handy, one of which, is actally the final project my team is currently working on.
