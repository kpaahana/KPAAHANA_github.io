Last year, my aunty (who's a complete star wars fanatic) finally purchased the Lego Star Wars Millenial Falcon "for her son" (as she claims). But of course she had no intention of wasting her precious time trying to figure it out--so I had to do it.  Who would of have thought one model could be so complex with a tremendous amount of pieces, 1,329 TO BE EXACT.

I slaved away for hours, and fter I was finally done, she took it, put it in a display case, and that was it... WHAT A WASTE OF MY LIFE. However, I have to admit that it probably would have been impossible to finish if it weren't for that trusty, old instruction manual-- a user's step-by-step guide to building the Lego Star Wars Millenial Falcon 101. 

So when I hear "design patterns", I think of my own instruction manual on how to figure out how to finish constructing different solutions solve many different situations that might come up in the coding process. 


I myself have recently used the publish-subscribe design pattern with in the project we have created in Fall semester 2017. Our group was tasked to create a forum like website which would help UH students give questions and get Answers from other people with in UH that also have accounts. This would be an ever-changing type of system by users and creators of the website. Adding new posts would create a whole new type of topic for specific threads of which other subscribers would need to see so the site needs to be update every time a change happens to the site. This is one example to the many other patterns I might have used in my CS career already. As you can see the idea of design patterns give you a footing so you can move progress forward with confidence and donâ€™t have to mysterious walk into the unknown.
