Have you've ever known someone who loves to work in a cluddered environment, claiming that "it's organized in its own way"?

I have. And it's simple -- I don't get it.

It's understandable if someone has a few things scattered around his/her area, but once it reaches the point where mountains of questionable artifacts start to form is when my anxiety starts to kick in. I morph into a spring cleaning monster that won't stop until everything is perfectly put in its place. (I wouldn't particularly catergorize myself as OCD or a perfectionist, but to be honest, if I had a labelmaker I think I'd be the person to label my wall "WALL".) It just gives me a great feeling when an environment is neat and organized, making it so much easier to find things.  

I think that's why I find "coding standards" amazing. Sure, it can be quite trivial when you have to make sure the everything is consistent throughout your code. However, when you think about how much time you're saving by doing so, it's completely worth it. I can't express how much I hate it when I'd look at my past codes and everything is all bundled up together: no idents, no comments, no organization! It make sit so difficult to read and understand the code that I feel bad for the TA of professor who had to evaluate it. 

Finding order in chaos? I don't think so.
