Overall, as I've never used a different UI framework, Semantic UI is great. I love the fact that I have so much more options when creating, and being able to add a bunch of details to my work makes it so much more interesting and finalized. Also, the code isn't really anything crazy complicated, it's great for first timers like myself. 

Semantic can be used for building both simple (and truly complex) layouts, but also for theming an existing layout to better reflect your design preferences and choices. Ofcourse, if you only need to create a super simple, basic website then it doesn't really make sense to take all that time usign UI frameworks when you could complete the project.
