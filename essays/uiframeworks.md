Overall, as I've never used a different UI framework, Semantic UI is great. I love the fact that I have so much more options when creating, and being able to add a bunch of details to my work makes it so much more interesting and finalized. Also, it's not crazy complicated or anything, and the code is fairly easy to understand, so it's great for first timers who might not know what to expect. 

Semantic can be used for building both simple (and truly complex) layouts, but also for theming an existing layout to better reflect your design preferences and choices. Ofcourse, if you only need to create a super simple, basic website then it doesn't really make sense to take all that time usign UI frameworks when you could complete the project. However, if your a perfectionist like me (who will literally spend hours to make sure that every word and image has the desired size, color, and spacing), the more options the better.
