For as long as I can remember, art has always been my passion. There’s just something about taking a simple emotion or idea and bringing it to life that is completely incredible to me. Sadly, due to family pressures, I am not allowed to pursue a degree “just in art”. 

So, since the importance of technology and computers seems to becoming more and more evident in this day and age, I wondered how I could incorporate my love for art and design into a computer-related job. At first, I thought it would be impossible to find an occupation that integrated both the arts and computers. However, after thinking about it a little more, I realized that these two subjects may not be such polar opposites after all. As the years progress, art is becoming more and more electronic and computer-based, and they’ll probably be a time where it becomes completely digital.

With these ideas in mind, I’m planning on pursuing a career in animation, web development, or game design. All of these occupations will require both an artistic and technological ability to thrive. To help prepare myself after graduation, I will specifically be looking for classes from the art and computer science department that incorporate both subjects in the class, for example, computer graphics, video game design and development, software engineering, digital imaging, electronic arts, and so on. 

Every person has his/her own preferences, so I'm looking forward to using different programming systems to see which one I'm drawn to. Although I'm not there quite yet, I hope that in the future I'll be able to have a love and passion for coding as I do art.
