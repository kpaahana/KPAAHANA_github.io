When I hear the phrase "smart" questions, I immediately think of something ridiculous like "I'm not smart enough to ask a smart question". Little did I know that putting in a little extra effort was all it took. 

After reading the article, "How To Ask Questions The Smart Way", by Eric Steven Raymond I learned that my current self is terrible at asking questions. And after reading it through, I know the reason why--I'm lazy. Instead of researching the topic and other sources before-hand, when I'm stuck on something I immediately go into "stupid question mode". I just ask the first things that come to mind, and by doing so, not only am I wasting the time of the other person but also the opportunity to learn and gain the confidence to find the answer by myself. 

While browsing through Stack Overflow and after looking at the actual questions and answers, there was a clear distinction between the ones who were "last-minute questioners" (like myself) or the ones who put in the effort. The people asking smart questions seemed to have some understanding of hat they were asking, and they recieved genuine replies and fast, efficient results. 

So really, when you do the math, putting in at least the slightest amount of time and effort to come up with a decent question can make all the difference.
