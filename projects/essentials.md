UH Essentials is a website where a person (that must have a UH login and password) can access to ask questions they are unsure of or answer the questions of their peers. My group members were April Bala and Creighton Gorai. We used Reddit, a popular Q & A type of site, as inspiration when creating UH Essentails. And our site contained 5 main threads: Campus Events, Campus Security, Commuting, Degree Programs, and Food Services. We chose to narrow down the amount of threads available to make it easier for a person to categorize which area their question would be in, and also because we wanted to minimize the amount of "random, off-topic" posts as much as possible.

I feel like the a bunch of the pages were an overall collaboration because there'd be times where we would start working on an issue and then pass it over to another group member who'd have an idea of how to work on it. On Milestone 1 I worked on the landing page and profile page, and for milestone 2 I changed the landing page and the topic pages for each thread (except the food thread, which April did). Sadly, I couldn't get to all of the pages as I had wished, so I did 3 pages per thread. 

There were a couple of dropdowns in the profile and submit page that, for some reason, didn't work after we deployed. It was definitely strange since it had been working perfectly fine before then. Our overall vision for the site was for it to be for all UH campuses, so if we had more time to work on the project I would have loved to try and get that to work. However, since we still had a few things to fix on our site that wasn't properly working we would work on that first. I would have liked to work more on the whole design of te site to make it look for interesting and fun to look at, but since are main focus was getting it to work properly there wasn't much time to make it look super appealing. 

Overall, this project was actually a really challenging but fun one to work on. I defintely learned how difficult it is to actually create a website as I don't we wouldnt have gone as far as we did without the help of the Bowfolios and Digits template.
