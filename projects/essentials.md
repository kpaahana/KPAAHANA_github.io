New to UH or want to learn more about your campus?


Well, with UH Essentials you can learn everything, you want to or need to know, about the campus that you are attending. UH Essentials is a forum-like Meteor application for the whole University of Hawaii (UH) system, where you can learn about Degree Programs, Food Services, Commuting to, from, or around campus, Campus Security during the day and night, and Campus Events from actual students and professors that work or have experienced the UH life before. The UH Essentials app offers all the essential information you might want to know as a new comer or even a veteran who hasn't done much exploring around campus.

It kinda of an overall collaboration with each of the pages, but the main ones I worked on were the landing, profile, and topic question pages. If we were to have more time to work on the project I would have loved to make sure everything worked properly. I defintely learned how difficult it is to actually create a website as I don't we wouldnt have gone as far as we did without the help of the Bowfolios and Digits template.
