summary: Experimentation with light and color
---

For this project I chose to experiement with light and color. I wanted to make people feel relaxed and just like a “feel good” type of expression. I was able to the images by going into a pitch black space and shining light on an object.The cool thing was, I only needed a CD to create the images. 

For the audio, I really wanted to contrast it to the more fast-paced soundtrack in my abstract video. I was playing around with the different possible beats to make, and I got this really nice and steady heart beat sound that I ended up using as the basis of my entire sound. For the rest of it all I got samples from audio tool and mashed it all together. 

If you havent looked at my project 1, then you wouldn't know, but all of the sound was created through the website, [AudioTool](http://audiotool.com). The website contains a countless array of musical tools to create the perfect sound or music for an individual to use for his/her videos.

If I were to do this project again I would definitely try to get the images to be a little more crisp and try to experiment more with the shapes and colors. I’d also like to try out different types of objects to see what other images I can create. Overall, I was pretty satisfied with the way the colors and sound turned out.
