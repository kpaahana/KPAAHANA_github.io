For my phenomenon I chose light and color, and for my emotion, I wanted it  to make people feel relaxed and just like a “feel good” type of expression. Similar to how I made my abstract video, I obtained the images seen to your right by going into a pitch black space and shining light on an object. The difference was that instead of using a glass cup and food coloring, I only needed a CD to get these images.
