For this project I created a short, forty-four second, stop motion video which encapsulates the three main aspects of my dog, Brody's, life: eating, sleeping, and playing.

The process in making this video was a long one. Most days when filming my dog was fairly cooperative, but for some reason while I was filming the scene in the hallway of him moving forward, he was giving me the hardest time. He just wouldn’t sit still! It got so frustrating to the point where I wanted to scrap all those days of filming with him and start over with a completely different concept, but after countless brainstorming and over a hundred pictures and videos later, I was finally able to produce a piece which I was satisied with. 

The sound track was created through the website, [AudioTool](http://audiotool.com), which is, according to the site, is a "powerful online music production studio right in your browser". The website contains a countless array of musical tools to create the perfect sound or music for an individual to use for his/her videos.

Overall, I was pretty satisfied with the outcome of my video. I don’t really know if I’m going to want to do another stop motion video with my dog ever again, but the whole process was a really fun experience. It definitely gave me a higher appreciation for the time and work it takes to making these kinds of videos.
