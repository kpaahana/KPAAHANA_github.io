In my abstract video I used bubbles, food coloring, water, and light to create the images shown. I was kind of just experimenting with a bunch of different elements and their combinations until I finally came across the bubbles. Although fairly simple to create (literally just blew bubbles with a straw), the bubbles created a very nice depth and layering to the piece that was very visually appealing. When using a straw to blow the bubbles, it also produced a random, explosive movement which I liked very much. 

<div class="ui images">
  <img class="ui centered rounded floated image" src="/images/B1.png"  width= "200" height="200">
  <img class="ui centered rounded floated image" src="/images/B2.png"  width= "200" height="200"> 
  <img class="ui centered rounded floated image" src="/images/B3.png"  width= "200" height="200">
</div>

I used the negative effect and maxed the saturation to try to mask the look of the bubbles. I also sped up the video a lot to make it the whole thing seem a little more chaotic. While making the video the images seemed to be like a sneak peak into the anatomy of an alien brain or some type of unknown organism; it was an interesting concept to think of. 

As I watched the video repeatedly, it was more and more apparent of the difference in quality on the depth and visual appeal of some scenes compared to others. In retrospect, I had more than enough length in the video to cut down in some scenes that weren’t really up to par with the rest (and it probably would have strengthened the piece).

If you havent looked at my project 1, then you wouldn't know, but all of the sound was created through the website, [AudioTool](http://audiotool.com). The website contains a countless array of musical tools to create the perfect sound or music for an individual to use for his/her videos.

Overall, I was satisfied with the outcome of the video. The visuals turned out well, and I’m a sucker when it comes to colorful images, so I liked it even more after adding the negative effect and saturation. I think I was so caught up on making the visuals nice that the sound was lacking. It also didn’t help that my video was kind of long, so it only brought out the repetitiveness of the sound even more. If I were to do this project again, I’d try to spend more time perfecting the sound and making the video match the sound more smoothly.
