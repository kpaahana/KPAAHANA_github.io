For this project my friend and I created a game in which a player is sent on a journey to find the gold. The whole point of the game is to basically make it to the end without dying. Each choice a player makes will then carry on in the next scene, creating a sort of butterfly effect. 

We also made short, mini games to play during the journey for the player to enjoy. The games mainly consisted of mazes and "collect the object" type of activities.

Sadly (for the player), we made the game unbeatable. So, for example, even if the player made all the correct choices through out the entire game, the last scene will always end in death. (Basically, the whole thing is a big troll to frustrate the player.)
