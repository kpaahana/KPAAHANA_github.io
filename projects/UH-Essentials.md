summary: Ever have questions about the University of Hawaii, but your not sure where to go? With UH Essentials
---

New to UH or want to learn more about your campus?

Well, with UH Essentials you can learn everything, you want to or need to know, about the campus that you are attending. UH Essentials is a forum-like Meteor application for the whole University of Hawaii (UH) system, where you can learn about Degree Programs, Food Services, Commuting to, from, or around campus, Campus Security during the day and night, and Campus Events from actual students and professors that work or have experienced the UH life before. The UH Essentials app offers all the essential information you might want to know as a new comer or even a veteran who hasn't done much exploring around campus.




One of those projects should present the application you developed for this class. The page should provide an overview of the project, what your contributions to the project were, what you learned from this experience, and one or more screenshots. It should include a link to the Organization GitHub Page associated with the project for those who want to see the source code and learn more about it. All project pages should include at least one screen image.
